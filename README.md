# link_zobj_skeleton_offset_updater
A small utility I created to speed up the process of porting zobj files with Link's hierarchy between games. Primarily intended for use with zzplayas.

This tool was basically made to cut out the tedious work I had to do when porting child Link's model from *Ocarina of Time* to *Majora's Mask*.

Most of the porting work was automated by the lovely folks who released zzobjman and zzplayas. Check those tools out at [z64.me](http://www.z64.me/)!
